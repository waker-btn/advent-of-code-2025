# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) programming puzzles, organized by year and day.

I've started in 2025 but I'm making my way back through the years!

## Notes

- Each solution is self-contained.
- Notes files may contain explanations, strategies, or observations for each puzzle.
